- ## Kinds of aliases in VCCV 2015
    - [-V]
      - Meant for when a syllable starts with a vowel next to silence
    - [V]
      - Meant to extend vowels across notes
    - [_V]
      - Meant for when your missing a [CV] (mostly, in this case, for [ngV]) and to be used with the C_k system (See C_k system for more)
    - [V-]
      - Meant for when a syllable ends in a vowel next to silence    
    - [-CV]
      -  Meant for /CV/ pairs that are next to silences
    - [CV]
        - Meant for /CV/ pairs that are next to vowels or consonants from the last syllable
    - [_CV]
        - Meant to be combinde with onset [CC]s to form onset consonant clusters
        - the only consonants are [r] [l] [y] and [w]
    - Onset [-CC]
        - Meant to be combinde with [_CV] to form onset consonant clusters that are next to silences
    - Onset [CC]
        - Meant to be combinde with [_CV] to form onset consonant clusters that are next to vowels or consonants from the last syllable
    - Coda [CC]
      - Falls under the C_k system
      - Meant to be combinde with [VC-]s to form coda consonant clusters next to vowels (see C_k system for more) or consonants from the next syllable
    - Coda [CC-]
      -   Meant to be combinde with [VC-]s to form coda consonant clusters next to sillence, or to be used as a replacement for Coda [CC]s for softer consonants
    - Coda [VCC]
      - Falls under the C_k system
      - Coda consonant clusters used next to vowels (see C_k system for more) or consonants from the next syllable
    - Coda [VCC-]
      - Coda consonant clusters used next to next to sillence, or to be used as a replacement for Coda [VCC]s for softer consonants
    - [VC]
        - Falls under the C_k system
        - Meant to be used for singualar coda consonants next to other consonants or next to a vowel when the consonant doesn't fall on the same syllable (see VC_k system for more)
    - [V C]
        - Meant to transion from a vowel to a consonent that falls on the next syllable
    - [VC-]
        - Meant to transion from a vowel to a consonent that falls on the same syllable, to be put next to silence when a syllable ends in a consonent, or as a replacement for a [VC] for a softer consonant.
    - [C C]
        - Meant to be combinded with a [VC-] to functions like a [VC] but a specific consonant transtion instead of a [k] or [t].
      
- ## C_k System
  - The C_k system refers to how VCCV 2015 uses [VC] and [CV]/[_V] for [VC.CV] or [VC.V] connections.
  - When a syllable ends in a consonant and the next Syllable is just a vowel, using a pair [VC][_V] when reasult in the consonant sounding like it's comeing from the last syllable instead of the next one, where using [VC][CV] pair may make things sound like the consonant is coming from the next syllable. (See Consonant Syllable Placement for more)

- ## Consonant Syllable Placement
  - VCCV as a system cares deeply about where Consonants fall in syllables, it changes what type of allies is used depending on where they fall.
    - Examples
      - [p@s.p0rt] should be pharsed as [-p@][@s][p0][0r-][rt-] while [p@.sp0rt] should be [-p@][@ sp][sp0][0r-][rt-].
      - [ku.myu.ni.ddE] should be [-ku][u m][my][_yo][o n][ni][i dd][ddE] while [kum.yu.ni.ddE] should be [-ku][um-][m y][yo][o n][ni][i dd][ddE].
      - [vAr.E] should be [-vA][Ar-][rE] while [vA.rE] should be [-vA][A r][rE].
  - In order for this to be intuetive for the user, it should be clear where consonants fall in syllables

            - Makes it very clear that the [s] and [p] fall on two different syllables
        - OpenUTAU

            - It's very vague where the [s] and [p] fall
